# Quarantine Productivity

## Description

People who aren't used to being around the house might find some frustration while either quarantining or just social-distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak period. This application is meant specifically to be a task manager for those who are used to a schedule with less time in the house.

## Features

* User can add tasks with dates and tags to filter them
* User can get recommendations for tasks related to specific topics
* User can view all of their completed tasks and get a total number of productive hours

## Tech

Quarantine Productivity is written in React, with redux managing state. Redux is set up with actions to make calls to the back-end to retrieve user tasks, sign them in, and create new accounts.
